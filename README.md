# Test Interface for Multiple Embedded Protocols

This is an Open Source Hardware board based around the FTDI FT2232H chip to
provide breakouts, buffering, and level conversion for a number of common
embedded hardware interfaces.  At present, this includes:

* SPI
* I2C
* JTAG
* SWD
* UART

It's intended to be easy to use and work with open source software, including
tools like OpenOCD and Flashrom.
